TODOs before release
====================
* Add examples


User Suggestions
================
 - select tracks from a playlist by a date range
 - create a new playlist every time the program runs (with date or time in playlist name)
 - substitute explicit for non-explicit and vice versa

Testing
========
New user that fails to give permission gets proper page.

Bugs
=====
* don't allow scheduling in the past
* remove deleted programs that are shared from the import list
* can't set schedule to never

Later on
==========
* add date ranges for my saved tracks/albums - this will allow for compoments that get mysaved tracks for the last year.
* Add text when there are no programs
